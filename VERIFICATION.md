# Verification

Environment: Windows 11, Hermes Agent 0.22.7, Python 3.12.10, Node 24.21.0, npm 11.19.0, Git 2.56.0.

## Official plugin validation

```text
hermes plugins validate plugin --install-deps
```

Result: passed.

- manifest
- manifest fields
- requires_hermes
- config schema
- requires_env
- oauth
- loadable (`__init__.py`, `desktop/plugin.js`)
- python dependencies
- capability probe
- declared tools
- declared hooks
- declared middleware
- built-in tool collisions
- security scan
- no core override
- desktop surface
- isolation

## Python checks

```text
ruff format --check .
ruff check .
mypy
pytest --cov=session_rewind --cov-report=term-missing
```

Result: green. 55 tests passed, 89.27% coverage.

## Desktop checks

```text
cd ui
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Result: green. `plugin/desktop/plugin.js` builds to a single ESM artifact. The minified artifact has no comments and imports only `@hermes/plugin-sdk`, `react` and `react/jsx-runtime`. CI fails if the artifact differs from a fresh build.

## Git engine

Integration tests create a temporary repository and verify:

- A snapshot does not change HEAD, the real index or the working tree.
- Shadow refs pin snapshots.
- A detached worktree restores the snapshot.
- Cleanup removes the worktree.
- Tree-to-tree diffs report the expected additions.
- The verify runner returns exit codes, timeouts and missing-command errors.

## API

FastAPI tests cover health, sessions, event pages, event detail, search, snapshots, branches, bookmarks, compare, fork prepare, fork commit, verify, cleanup and error paths.

## Live Hermes Desktop test

Pending. The plugin has been validated in isolation with the official checker. The next step is installing `plugin/` into the Hermes profile, recording a live session, preparing a fork with a real worktree, running the native branch chain and running a verify command.

## Demo

Pending. Script: `docs/demo-script.md`.

## Catalog

Draft: `catalog/session-rewind.yaml`. The final submission replaces the placeholder SHA with the pushed 40-character commit, updates the platforms after the CI matrix, and adds screenshots pinned to the same commit.
